I'm an economist, data scientist, and programmer. I grew up (and was mostly raised) in a massive coastal city in West Africa. I spend too much time reading (I'm currently reading [Middlemarch](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot)) and gaming (I can't get enough of [Hades](https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-review) and [Celeste](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/25/celeste-review)).

- 👔 I currently work @ a do-tank helping test, scale, and implement promising solutions to city-specific public-policy challenges.
- 🔭 I'm currently building one app to predict historic premier league results and another app to identify and recommend songs based on vibe
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on DS and ML projects. I have particularly robust expertise/experience in economics, econometrics, R, automation, and data processing.
- 📫 It's easiest to reach me via email
