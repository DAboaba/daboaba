I'm an economist, data scientist, and programmer with particularly robust expertise in econometrics, R, automation, and data processing. I grew up (and was mostly raised) in a massive coastal city in West Africa. I spend too much time reading (I'm currently reading [Middlemarch](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot)) and gaming (I can't get enough of [Hades](https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-review)).
